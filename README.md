# SpaceEye Icons

Icons for the [SpaceEye application](https://github.com/KYDronePilot/SpaceEye)

## Info

This project stores source SVGs and build tools to convert them into the various
icons needed in the [SpaceEye app](https://github.com/KYDronePilot/SpaceEye).
Builds must be run on macOS machines, since the `iconutil` command (exclusive to
macOS) is needed to create `.icns` files.
